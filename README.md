# DIABETES-PREDICTION

This repository contains code and data for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health-related features. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques and utilizes a dataset of patients with labeled diabetes outcomes.

## Data

The dataset used for this prediction task is sourced from kaggle.com, and it includes a set of features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other relevant health indicators. The dataset is provided in a structured format, with each record containing both the feature values and the corresponding binary label indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

Due to privacy and usage restrictions, the dataset cannot be included in this repository. However, detailed instructions on how to obtain the dataset are provided below.

## Requirements

To run the code and perform the diabetes prediction, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the code.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain the diabetes dataset by following the instructions provided in the "Data" section below.
3. Place the dataset file(s) in the appropriate directory within the repository.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and build the diabetes prediction model.
6. Use the trained model to predict diabetes likelihood for new data or to explore feature importance.
7. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different machine learning algorithms as per your requirements.
